- 👋 Hi, I’m Shawn Grant (git_user: @shxwn21)
- 👀 I’m interested in seach systems and information extraction. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PHP, postgresSQL, and MySQL for backend dev, Haskell
      for FSA generation, and pandas in python for research data management.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small mobile app projects using React and Nodejs. 
- 📫 How to reach me:

     - www.linkedin.com/in/shawn-grant-3216a5185
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to ice skate in my freetime and am trying to learn the piano. 

- For Personal Projects, please see to the Repository Tab. If you are looking for coursework, I   will have to present them to you in person, as there are academic policies in place that 
  prevent me from placing them publically onto gitHub.
